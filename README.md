Project made for school. It helps the user check the weather forecast for the upcoming week around the world. 

By clicking on any location on the world map, the user can view the weather forecast for the upcoming week and see the shortest flight route to that destination. The project utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather information and the AeroDataBox API to calculate flight routes.

Done using JavaScript and HTML-code.
